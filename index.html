      <h2>Dear elected officials,</h2>
      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>
          We, the undersigned 11 organizations, write to express our fear and
          anger regarding the state of our carceral and punitive immigration
          system. Over the past few months, U.S. Immigration and Customs
          Enforcement‚Äôs (ICE‚Äôs) potential for new levels of depravity has been
          put on display for all to see. However, much of ICE‚Äôs cruelty is not
          new. <br /><br />
          ICE was created out of the Islamophobic fear and panic after 9/11.
          Lawmakers preyed on the nation‚Äôs worst impulses to funnel billions of
          taxpayer dollars into an agency that primarily exists to terrorize
          vulnerable communities, separate families, and enrich the private
          prison industrial complex. <br /><br />
          Since its inception in 2003, ICE has operated as a rogue agency that
          has consistently broken local, state, federal, and international laws;
          evaded substantive oversight and accountability; and engaged in
          inhumane practices in its detention facilities that fall squarely
          within the definition of torture. Between January 2019 and June 2024,
          at least 70 immigrants died in ICE custody<sup

              href="https://americanoversight.org/resource/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/"
              target="_blank"
              class="ref"
              >1</a
            ></sup
          >, 95% of whose deaths were preventable<sup

              target="_blank"
              >2</a
            ></sup
          >. At the same time, the agency‚Äôs budget has more than doubled since
          its inception, taking an increasing share of taxpayer dollars every
          year without a modicum of accountability. <br /><br />
          The agency‚Äôs racist bedrock is further cemented by its highly
          discriminatory day-to-day operations. Arrests and interrogations are
          routinely conducted on the basis of skin color alone<sup

          >; Black immigrants are substantially more likely than their non-Black
          counterparts to face longer detentions, be placed in solitary
          confinement, and pay steeper immigration bonds for their release<sup

          Even if ICE had spent the past two decades following the law, it has
          failed to fulfill its purported goal of protecting our communities.
          The American people have been sold the lie that public safety comes in
          the form of workplace raids and mass detention from corporations and
          politicians who seek to profit off of a fundamentally broken system.
          Reports suggest this big lie has actively eroded public safety rather
          than bolstering it; local law enforcement partnerships with ICE, such
          as 287(g) agreements and Secure Communities programs, have been proven
          to increase community members‚Äô likelihood of violent victimization.
          Furthermore, the agency has illegally exceeded its scope by detaining
          anyone who appears to step out of line: international students who
          hold particular political views, elected officials attempting to hold
          the institution accountable, and individuals who appear to ‚Äúfit a
          description,‚Äù regardless of legal status. These individuals pose no
          threat to public safety, it is the masked agents and the vigilantes
          whom they have embolded who do.
          <br /><br />
          This is an agency beyond reform. With each year it continues to
          operate, we will continue to see more extrajudicial kidnappings, more
          family separation, more community instability, and‚Äîon a general
          level‚Äîan immigration system skewed towards punishment and carcerality
          rather than humanity, security, and understanding. This is true across
          administrations; regardless of the party in power, ICE has enjoyed a
          steady increase in funding year over year, lining the pockets of
          private prison contractors and eating away at resources that could be
          used to holistically address the more pressing issues our communities
          face. <br /><br />

          The call to abolish ICE is not a new one‚Äîit once was a rallying cry
          that candidates and elected officials tapped into to earn the votes of
          immigrant communities and their allies. As the violent and immoral
          mission of ICE has become normalized over time, many of those same
          lawmakers have fallen silent regarding their original calls for
          abolition. <br /><br />

          We call on Congress to use all available powers and resources to
          dismantle the immigration detention system and ICE, including opposing
          an increase in funding for the agency proposed in the current
          reconciliation bill. History will not look back fondly on leaders who
          lacked the courage to take a stand against the degradation of human
          rights and democracy to cling to their positions of power. We demand
          that you use your authority and influence to phase out ICE, rebuke
          every aspect of the Trump administration‚Äôs illegal mass deportation
          campaign, and commit to a future guarantee of safety and dignity for
          all immigrant communities.<br /><br />
